<get_logs_by_date>
Script to fetch logs from PythonAnywhere for a specific date.

This script helps retrieve historical logs that have been rotated,
useful for investigating issues that occurred on specific dates.

USAGE:
    python get_logs_by_date.py <date> [log_types...]

ARGUMENTS:
    date                    - Target date in various formats (required)
    log_types (optional)    - Specific log types: access, error, server

DATE FORMATS SUPPORTED:
    - YYYY-MM-DD           (e.g., 2024-01-15)
    - MM/DD/YYYY           (e.g., 01/15/2024)
    - DD/MM/YYYY           (e.g., 15/01/2024)
    - yesterday, today     (relative keywords)
    - N                    (N days ago, e.g., 1, 7, 30)

USAGE EXAMPLES:
    python get_logs_by_date.py yesterday
    python get_logs_by_date.py 7                     # 7 days ago
    python get_logs_by_date.py 2024-01-15
    python get_logs_by_date.py today error           # Only error logs for today
    python get_logs_by_date.py yesterday access server
    python get_logs_by_date.py 01/15/2024 error      # US date format

EXPECTED OUTPUTS:

1. Successful execution:
   === PythonAnywhere Historical Logs Fetcher ===

2. No logs found:
   === SUMMARY FOR 2024-01-01 ===
   Successfully fetched: 0/3 log files
   ‚ùå No logs found for this date.
      This could mean:
      - Logs for this date have been deleted/rotated
      - The date is too recent (logs might still be in current files)
      - The date format or log file naming convention has changed
   
   üí° Try:
      - Checking logs for adjacent dates
      - Using 'get_latest_logs.py' for recent logs
      - Using 'log_utils.py list' to see available historical logs

3. Invalid date format:
   Error parsing date: Unable to parse date: invalid-date
   Supported formats:
     - YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2024-01-15)
     - today, yesterday
     - Number of days ago (e.g., 1, 7, 30)

4. Invalid log types:
   Invalid log types: ['invalid_type']
   Valid types are: ['access', 'error', 'server']

OUTPUT FILES:
    Historical logs are saved with date and timestamp format:
    - access_log_2024-01-15_143022.txt
    - error_log_2024-01-15_143022.txt
    - server_log_2024-01-15_143022.txt

LOG FILE SEARCH STRATEGY:
    The script tries multiple naming conventions for rotated logs:
    - domain.log_type.log.YYYY-MM-DD
    - domain.log_type.log-YYYY-MM-DD  
    - domain.log_type.YYYY-MM-DD.log

TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS:
    - Recent dates (today/yesterday): Use get_latest_logs.py instead
    - Old dates: Logs may have been automatically deleted
    - Check available dates: Use python log_utils.py list
    - Alternative dates: Try adjacent dates (¬±1 day)

ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS:
    PA_API_TOKEN, PA_USERNAME, PA_DOMAIN, PA_HOST must be set in .env file

</tools>


You can use as many tools as you need and in any order to identify the issue. You can also:
- Add debug statements in the code if needed.
- Read the log files saved by the tools in `scripts/logs`

You CANNOT:
- change any existing functionality (only fix bugs that break functionality)

You SHOULD:
- Troubleshoot as much as you need with all the available tools
- Diagnose the issue
- Test to make sure your diagnosis is correct
- Provide a solution
